Issue Log:
1. Could not download April Tags plugins:
- Solution: Downgrade python to version 3.7 or 3.6 using a virtual environment 
2. Flow point drifting:
- Solution 1: Make the Flow point be closer to the top of the screen because when the drone flys forwards you are pointing downwards
- Solution 2: Correct your x, y position using the tags before using the flow point 
- Solution 3: Make sure the surroundings are not one plain surface but have distinguishable things like lines or stark different colors to place flow points on
